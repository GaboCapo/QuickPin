# ðŸš§ Project Archived: QuickPin ðŸš§

The "QuickPin" project has been publicly archived because the core functionality of creating shortcuts directly from the browser via a shortcut key or button is not natively supported by standard browser extensions. However, we have conceptualized a bridge solution that aims to overcome this limitation.

## Bridge Solution Concept

The idea is to develop a comprehensive toolset that integrates seamlessly with the browser, allowing users to create desktop shortcuts for websites with a simple shortcut key or button click. This toolset will act as a bridge between the browser and the operating system, automating the shortcut creation process and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Future Updates

I will post updates and provide a link to the new project in this README as soon as development begins. Stay tuned for more information on how this innovative solution will bring enhanced functionality and convenience to your browsing experience.

Thank you for your interest and support!

# ChromeQuickPin

**ChromeQuickPin** is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the process of creating shortcuts for your favorite websites. With just one click, you can add buttons to quickly create a shortcut or "install" the website, allowing it to open in its own window.

## Features

- **Quick Shortcut Creation**: Easily create shortcuts for websites without navigating through multiple menus.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface.
- **Linux Tested**: This extension has been tested only on Linux systems.

## Chrome Web Store Installation

 ðŸš§ Coming Soon ðŸš§


## Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable Developer Mode (toggle in the top right corner).
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension.

## Usage

1. Click on the ChromeQuickPin icon in the Chrome toolbar.
2. Enter the URL of the website you want to pin.
3. Click "Pin" to create a shortcut that opens the website in its own window.

## Functionality

ChromeQuickPin allows you to skip the steps of clicking on the three dots, then selecting "Stream, Save, and Share," and finally choosing "Create Shortcut" or "{WebsiteName} Install." Instead, you will have two buttons directly in the toolbar, located to the right of the address bar, next to the three dots and the puzzle piece icon for extensions.
